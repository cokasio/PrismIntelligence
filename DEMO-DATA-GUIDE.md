Update the data arrays in each generator method to include your specific scenarios.

### Change Agent Mappings
Edit expected agents in `seed-demo-data.js`:
```javascript
const expectedAgents = {
  'Your-Document.xlsx': ['AgentName1', 'AgentName2']
};
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module 'xlsx'"
```bash
cd apps/api
npm install xlsx json2csv
```

### Documents not appearing
- Check `demo-documents/` folder exists
