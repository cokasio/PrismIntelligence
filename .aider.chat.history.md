I understand that you want me to follow the *SEARCH/REPLACE block* rules strictly. However, you haven't given me a specific task to work on yet, and you haven't added any files to the chat that I can edit.

When you have a specific request, please let me know what you'd like to change, and I'll identify which files need to be added to the chat for editing.
