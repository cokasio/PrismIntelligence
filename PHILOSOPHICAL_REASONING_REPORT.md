3️⃣ EXECUTE Phase:

--- Step 1: InsightGeneratorAgent ---
Conclusion: Property shows margin erosion risk
Valid: true
Confidence: 0.85
Proof Steps:
  1. Given: GL5100 increase > $10,000 = true
  2. Given: RevenueGrowth = 0% = true
  3. All premises are true
  4. If premises are true, then MarginRisk = High

Valid: true
Confidence: 0.92
Proof Steps:
  1. Given: DSCR < 1.2 = true
  2. Given: LiquidityCoverage < 60 = true
  3. All premises are true
  4. If premises are true, then DebtCovenantBreach = True

--- Step 3: RiskFlaggerAgent ---
Conclusion: Tenant presents high risk profile
Valid: true
Confidence: 0.78
Proof Steps:
  1. Given: LatePayments > 2 = true
  2. Given: ComplaintCount > 3 = true
  3. All premises are true
  4. If premises are true, then TenantRisk = High

--- Step 4: SynthesisAgent ---
Conclusion: Multi-agent synthesis complete
Valid: true
Confidence: 0.85
Cross-validation: All agent statements are logically consistent

4️⃣ VERIFY Phase:
✅ No contradictions detected - all insights are logically consistent

5️⃣ REPORT Phase:
{
  "summary": {
    "totalInsights": 4,
    "validInsights": 4,
    "invalidInsights": 0,
    "contradictions": 0,
    "overallConfidence": 0.85
  },
  "narrative": "The philosophical reasoning system has completed its analysis. Out of 4 insights generated, 4 were logically proven. All insights are logically consistent with no contradictions. The overall confidence in the analysis is 85%. The system recommends proceeding with the suggested actions."
}
```

---

## 4️⃣ VERIFY Phase

### Logic Validation Results:
- ✅ **InsightGeneratorAgent**: Margin erosion proven (Rule L001)
- ✅ **ComplianceAgent**: Covenant breach proven (Rule L002)  
- ✅ **RiskFlaggerAgent**: Tenant risk proven (Rule L004)
- ✅ **SynthesisAgent**: All insights consistent

### Contradiction Analysis:
- **Total Contradictions**: 0
- **Cross-Agent Consistency**: 100%
- **Logic Integrity**: VERIFIED
