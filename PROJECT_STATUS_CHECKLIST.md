1. **Process documents** → Drop files in `incoming/` folder
2. **Generate insights** → AI analyzes and extracts key information
3. **Create tasks** → Automatic task generation with assignments
4. **Track ROI** → Time saved and value calculations
5. **Send notifications** → Email alerts for new tasks
6. **Store everything** → Complete database persistence

## 💰 Value Delivered So Far

With the current implementation, you can:
- Save 2-3 hours per document analysis
- Generate actionable tasks automatically
- Track potential value of improvements
- Never miss critical issues
- Maintain complete audit trail

## 🔧 Testing Everything

```bash
# Test the complete flow
1. npm run attachment-loop:dev
2. Drop a P&L in incoming/ folder
3. Watch AI analyze and generate tasks
4. Check database for stored results
5. Verify email notifications sent
6. Review ROI metrics

# Individual component tests
node test-enhanced-tasks.js      # Task generation
node test-database-integration.js # Database storage
node test-cloudmailin.js         # Email sending
node test-notifications.js       # Full notifications
```

## 📈 Recommendation

The backend is production-ready. Focus next on:
1. **Simple UI first** - Just display tasks and ROI
2. **API endpoints** - Connect UI to backend
3. **Deploy early** - Get user feedback
4. **Iterate based on usage** - Add features users actually need
