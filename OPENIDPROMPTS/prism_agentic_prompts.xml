  <Phase id="2" name="Source Trace">

      For each financial insight or KPI you generate, identify the exact source reference that supports it. This includes the filename, page number (for PDFs), or cell/row location (for spreadsheets).

  <Phase id="5" name="Insight-to-Task Loop">
    <Prompt>

      - Use concise language and link each task back to the original insight
      Prioritize actions that improve financial clarity or mitigate risk.
    </Prompt>
