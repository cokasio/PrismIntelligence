     * assignedRole: 'CFO' | 'PropertyManager' | etc.
     * propertyId: UUID
     * dateRange: { from: Date, to: Date }
   - Add pagination: ?page=1&limit=20
   - Sort options: dueDate, priority, potentialValue
   - Return format:
     {
       tasks: Task[],
       total: number,

## Critical Path (Priority Order)

1. **Tasks API + UI** (enables core value prop)
2. **File Upload** (closes the loop)
3. **ROI Dashboard** (proves value)
4. **Real-time** (polished experience)
5. **Mobile** (broader accessibility)
6. **Auth Polish** (production ready)

Focus on 1-3 first. Ship when those work. Add 4-6 based on user feedback.
