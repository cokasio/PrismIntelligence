# TaskMaster Integration for Financial Analysis Project

This is a lightweight Python implementation inspired by claude-task-master, specifically tailored for your financial analysis project.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from financial_analysis_taskmaster import FinancialAnalysisTaskmaster

# Initialize taskmaster
taskmaster = FinancialAnalysisTaskmaster()

# Set up financial analysis tasks
taskmaster.setup_financial_analysis_tasks()

# Track progress
taskmaster.track_analysis_progress("revenue", {"status": "Processing"})

# Complete tasks
taskmaster.complete_analysis_task("revenue", {"total": 100000})
```

## 📁 Structure

```
taskmaster/
├── __init__.py           # Package initialization
├── task.py              # Task data model
├── task_manager.py      # Core task management
└── context_manager.py   # AI context management

Integration files:
├── financial_analysis_taskmaster.py  # Main integration
└── financial_analyzer_enhanced.py    # Example enhanced analyzer
```
## 🎯 Features

### Task Management
- Create and track financial analysis tasks
- Set priorities and dependencies
- Track financial impact of tasks
- Organize by analysis type (revenue, cashflow, balance)

### Context Management
- Track data sources used
- Record AI interactions
- Maintain financial metrics
- Preserve analysis context across sessions

### Integration with Financial Analysis
- Automatic task creation for analysis workflows
- Progress tracking during analysis
- Result storage and retrieval
- Comprehensive reporting

## 💡 Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Task Creation
```python
from taskmaster import TaskManager, TaskPriority

tm = TaskManager()
task = tm.create_task(
    title="Analyze Q4 Revenue",
    description="Deep dive into Q4 revenue streams",
    priority=TaskPriority.HIGH,
    financial_impact=50000,
    analysis_type="revenue"
)
```
### 2. Enhanced Financial Analyzer
```python
from financial_analyzer_enhanced import EnhancedFinancialAnalyzer

analyzer = EnhancedFinancialAnalyzer()
analyzer.taskmaster.setup_financial_analysis_tasks()

# Analyze with automatic task tracking
results = analyzer.analyze_income_statement("income_data.csv")
```

### 3. Context Tracking
```python
from taskmaster import ContextManager

cm = ContextManager()

# Add data sources
cm.add_data_source("pm_gl_monthly_income_2023_2024.csv", "Monthly income data")

# Track AI interactions
cm.add_ai_interaction(
    task_id="task-123",
    prompt="Analyze revenue trends",
    response="Revenue shows 15% YoY growth...",
    model="claude"
)

# Update financial metrics
cm.update_financial_metrics({
    "total_revenue": 1500000,
    "profit_margin": 0.23,
    "growth_rate": 0.15
})
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The taskmaster creates a `.taskmaster/` directory in your project root to store:
- `tasks.json` - All task data
- `context.json` - Context and AI interaction history

## 🎨 Customization

You can extend the task model for your specific needs:

```python
# In task.py, we've added financial-specific fields:
financial_impact: Optional[float] = None
data_sources: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
analysis_type: Optional[str] = None
```

## 🚦 Integration with Existing Code

The taskmaster is designed to wrap around your existing financial analyzers:

1. **Minimal Changes**: Use the enhanced analyzer as a drop-in replacement
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add task tracking to existing functions
3. **Full Integration**: Build new features with task management from the start

## 📊 Benefits

- **Track Progress**: Know exactly where you are in complex analyses
- **Maintain Context**: Never lose track of what data you've analyzed
- **AI Memory**: Keep a record of all AI interactions for reference
- **Prioritize Work**: Focus on high-impact financial analyses first
- **Generate Reports**: Automatic task and progress reporting

## 🛣️ Roadmap

Future enhancements could include:
- Web dashboard for task visualization
- Integration with your existing dashboards
- Automated task creation from data uploads
- AI-suggested task prioritization
- Export to project management tools

This lightweight implementation gives you the core benefits of task management without the complexity of the full Node.js claude-task-master. It's specifically designed to work with your Python-based financial analysis tools.
