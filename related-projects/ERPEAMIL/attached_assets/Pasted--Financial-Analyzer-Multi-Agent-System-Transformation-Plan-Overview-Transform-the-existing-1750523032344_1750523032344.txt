# Financial Analyzer Multi-Agent System - Transformation Plan

## Overview
Transform the existing multi-agent conversation system from a ToDo app discussion tool into a comprehensive financial analysis system that uses 4 different LLMs to analyze property management financial data.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Components
- **Framework**: A2A (Agent-to-Agent) multi-agent system
- **Current Agents**: 2 agents (OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude)
- **Current Purpose**: Discussing ToDo app architecture
- **Available APIs**: 4 LLM providers configured in `.env`

### Available Financial Data
1. **Income Statement**: `pm_gl_monthly_income_2023_2024.csv` (24 months of P&L data)
2. **Balance Sheet**: `pm_gl_monthly_balance_2023_2024.csv` (24 months of financial position)
3. **Cash Flow**: `pm_gl_monthly_cashflow_2023_2024.csv` (24 months of cash flow data)

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Enhancement

#### 1.1 LLM Client Integration
- Add Google Gemini client integration
- Add DeepSeek client integration  
- Update import statements and client initialization
- Implement error handling for all 4 API providers

#### 1.2 Data Processing Infrastructure
```python
# New components to add:
class FinancialDataLoader:
    def load_income_statement(self) -> pd.DataFrame
    def load_balance_sheet(self) -> pd.DataFrame  
    def load_cash_flow(self) -> pd.DataFrame
    def calculate_key_metrics(self) -> Dict
    def validate_data_integrity(self) -> bool

class FinancialMetricsCalculator:
    def calculate_profitability_ratios(self) -> Dict
    def calculate_liquidity_ratios(self) -> Dict
    def calculate_leverage_ratios(self) -> Dict
    def calculate_efficiency_ratios(self) -> Dict
```

### Phase 2: Agent Reconfiguration

#### 2.1 Agent Role Updates
- Redefine agent roles and descriptions for financial analysis
- Update system prompts for financial domain expertise
- Configure specialized analysis instructions for each agent

#### 2.2 Conversation Flow Design
**Multi-Round Discussion Structure:**

1. **Round 1 - Initial Analysis** (Each agent analyzes their domain)
   - Income Statement Analyst: Revenue/expense trends
   - Balance Sheet Analyst: Financial position assessment  
   - Cash Flow Analyst: Cash generation analysis
   - Strategic Advisor: Overall financial health overview

2. **Round 2 - Cross-Analysis Discussion**
   - Agents ask questions and challenge assumptions
   - Identify correlations between different financial aspects
   - Discuss conflicting indicators or unusual patterns
   - Validate findings across different statements

3. **Round 3 - Strategic Integration**
