# Enhanced Agent Coordination - A2A2 + MCP Protocols

## ü§ù Overview

The **Enhanced Agent Coordination** module implements Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A2) and Multi-Agent Consensus Protocol (MCP) for Prism Intelligence. This enables AI agents to debate, challenge each other's conclusions, and reach consensus through structured democratic processes.

## üß† Core Concepts

### A2A2 Protocol (Agent-to-Agent)
- Agents communicate directly with each other
- Peer review of proposals and conclusions
- Challenge mechanisms for disagreement
- Collaborative problem-solving

### MCP Protocol (Multi-Agent Consensus)
- Structured consensus-building process
- Weighted voting based on expertise
- Dissent recording when consensus fails
- Logic validation of all proposals

## üìã Four-Phase Process

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **PROPOSAL Phase**
Each agent analyzes the task and proposes a solution:
```
FinanceBot: "Significant expense increase detected. Recommend immediate cost reduction."
ComplianceAgent: "Debt covenant breach imminent. Notify lender immediately."
RiskFlagger: "High risk detected. Property at risk of financial crisis."
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **CHALLENGE Phase**
Agents review and challenge each other's proposals:
```
TenantBot ‚Üí FinanceBot: "Cost reduction could impact tenant satisfaction"
LegalBot ‚Üí ComplianceAgent: "Premature notification could trigger adverse clauses"
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **RESOLUTION Phase**
Contradictions resolved through:
- Logic validation checks
- Evidence comparison
- Confidence adjustment
- Precedence rules

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **CONSENSUS Phase**
Final decision through:
- Weighted voting
- Majority/unanimous requirements
- Dissent recording if no consensus
- Confidence scoring

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Agent Configuration
```typescript
{
  agents: [
    { id: 'finance-bot', weight: 1.2, specialty: 'financial-analysis' },
    { id: 'tenant-bot', weight: 1.0, specialty: 'tenant-management' },
    { id: 'legal-bot', weight: 1.3, specialty: 'compliance' },
    { id: 'risk-flag', weight: 1.2, specialty: 'risk-assessment' }
  ]
}
```

### Consensus Configuration
```typescript
{
  minAgentsForConsensus: 3,
  consensusThreshold: 0.7,     // 70% agreement needed
  maxDebateRounds: 5,
  enableLogicValidation: true,
  requireUnanimous: false
}
```

## üí° Example: Financial Crisis Consensus

### Input
```typescript
{
  property: 'Sunset Towers',
  expenseIncrease: 25000,
  revenueGrowth: -5,
  dscr: 1.05,
  liquidityDays: 30
}
```

### Debate Process
```
1. PROPOSAL:
   - FinanceBot: "Implement emergency cost reduction"
   - ComplianceAgent: "Notify lender of covenant breach risk"
   - RiskFlagger: "Declare financial emergency status"

2. CHALLENGE:
   - TenantBot challenges FinanceBot: "May harm tenant retention"
   - MaintenanceBot challenges FinanceBot: "Could defer critical repairs"

3. RESOLUTION:
   - Cost reduction proposal confidence: 0.65 (reduced)
   - Lender notification confidence: 0.92 (maintained)
   - Emergency status confidence: 0.88 (maintained)

4. CONSENSUS:
   - Final: "Notify lender immediately while implementing selective cost controls"
   - Support: 5/7 agents (71%)
   - Dissent: TenantBot, MaintenanceBot
```

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Intelligent Debate**
- Agents use evidence-based arguments
- Logic validation on all proposals
- Contradiction detection
- Confidence-weighted opinions

### 2. **Democratic Decision-Making**
- No single agent dominates
- Expertise-based weight adjustments
- Minority opinions preserved
- Transparent process

### 3. **Dissent Recording**
When consensus fails:
```json
{
  "dissentRecord": [{
    "agentId": "tenant-bot",
    "agentName": "TenantBot",
    "reason": "Alternative conclusion reached",
    "alternativeConclusion": "Prioritize tenant retention over cost cuts",
    "confidence": 0.82
  }]
}
```

### 4. **Logic Integration**
- All proposals validated with propositional calculus
- Cross-references logic rules (L001, L002, etc.)
- Ensures mathematical consistency
- Builds on Critical Thinking Layer

## üìä Consensus Methods

### **Unanimous Consensus**
- All agents agree
- Highest confidence
- Rare but powerful

### **Majority Consensus**
- >50% of agents agree
- Standard decision mode
- Balanced approach

### **Weighted Consensus**
- Threshold met with weights
- Expertise matters
- Domain-specific decisions

### **Failed Consensus**
- No agreement reached
- All positions recorded
- Human intervention needed
- Learning opportunity

## üé® UI Integration

### Consensus Badge
```tsx
<Badge>
  {result.achieved ? (
    <>üß© Consensus Reached</>
  ) : (
    <>‚ö†Ô∏è Dissent Logged</>
  )}
</Badge>
```

### Debate Timeline
- Visual flow of proposals
- Challenge indicators
- Resolution markers
- Final consensus state

### Agent Activity Feed
- Real-time debate updates
- Challenge notifications
- Consensus progress
- Dissent alerts

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Implementation
```typescript
import { agentCoordinator } from './a2a2-protocol';

const result = await agentCoordinator.executeWithConsensus(
  'TASK-001',
  'Analyze property financial crisis',
  { /* task data */ }
);

if (result.achieved) {
  console.log('Consensus:', result.finalProposal);
} else {
  console.log('No consensus - review dissenting opinions');
}
```

### Custom Configuration
```typescript
const customCoordinator = new EnhancedAgentCoordination({
  requireUnanimous: true,
  consensusThreshold: 0.9,
  agentWeights: new Map([
    ['legal-bot', 2.0],  // Double weight for legal matters
    ['finance-bot', 1.5]
  ])
});
```
