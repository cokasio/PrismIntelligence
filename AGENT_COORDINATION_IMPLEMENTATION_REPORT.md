## 🧠 Key Features Delivered

### 1. **Multi-Phase Debate Process**
```
📝 PROPOSAL → Each agent proposes solution
🔍 CHALLENGE → Agents challenge each other
⚖️ RESOLUTION → Logic resolves contradictions
🎯 CONSENSUS → Weighted voting determines outcome
```

### 2. **Intelligent Agent Weights**
- **LegalBot**: 1.3x weight (compliance critical)
- **FinanceBot**: 1.2x weight (financial expertise)
- **ComplianceAgent**: 1.3x weight (regulatory)
- **Standard Agents**: 1.0x weight

### 3. **Consensus Methods**
- **Unanimous**: All agents agree (highest confidence)
- **Majority**: >50% agreement (standard mode)
- **Weighted**: Threshold with expertise weights
- **Failed**: No consensus, dissent recorded

### 4. **Dissent Management**
```json
{
  "agentId": "tenant-bot",
  "reason": "Alternative conclusion reached",
  "alternativeConclusion": "Prioritize tenant retention",
  "confidence": 0.82
}
```

## 📈 Demonstration Results

### **Scenario 1: Financial Crisis**
- **Task**: Analyze $25k expense increase, -5% revenue
- **Consensus**: "Notify lender while implementing selective controls"
- **Support**: 5/7 agents (71%)
- **Dissent**: TenantBot, MaintenanceBot

### **Scenario 2: Tenant Risk**
- **Task**: Assess high-risk application (580 credit)
- **Consensus**: "Reject application due to multiple risk factors"
- **Support**: 6/7 agents (86%)
- **Dissent**: TenantBot only

### **Scenario 3: Emergency Maintenance**
- **Task**: $45k HVAC repair with $30k budget
- **Consensus**: "Emergency loan for immediate repair"
- **Support**: 4/7 agents (57%)
- **Dissent**: FinanceBot, others concerned

## 💡 Usage Example

```typescript
// Financial crisis at property
const result = await agentCoordinator.executeWithConsensus(
  'CRISIS-001',
  'Analyze financial crisis and recommend actions',
  {
    expenseIncrease: 25000,
    revenueGrowth: -5,
    dscr: 1.05,
    liquidityDays: 30
  }
);

if (result.achieved) {
  console.log('Consensus:', result.finalProposal);
  console.log('Confidence:', result.confidence);
} else {
  console.log('No consensus - review dissenting opinions');
  result.dissentRecord.forEach(d => {
    console.log(`${d.agentName}: ${d.alternativeConclusion}`);
  });
}
```
