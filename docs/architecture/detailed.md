# Technical Architecture: Prism Intelligence

## System Overview

Prism Intelligence is built on a modern, scalable architecture that leverages the best of cloud services, AI capabilities, and automation tools. This document outlines the technical decisions, system components, and implementation details that make our platform both powerful and cost-effective.

## Architecture Principles

Our technical architecture follows several key principles that guide every implementation decision:

1. **API-First Design** - Every component communicates through well-defined APIs, enabling flexibility and future expansion
2. **Serverless Where Possible** - Minimize infrastructure management and maximize scalability
3. **Event-Driven Processing** - Asynchronous workflows that can handle variable loads efficiently
4. **Separation of Concerns** - Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility
5. **Fail-Safe Operations** - Built-in retry logic and error handling at every step

## Core Technology Stack

### Backend Services

**Primary Language**: Node.js / TypeScript
- Chosen for its excellent async handling, vast ecosystem, and strong typing with TypeScript
- Alternative: Python for specific AI/ML processing tasks

**API Framework**: Express.js / Fastify
- RESTful API design with OpenAPI documentation
- GraphQL consideration for complex data queries in later phases

**Authentication**: Supabase Auth / Auth0
- Secure, scalable authentication with support for enterprise SSO
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for multi-tenant architecture
### Data Layer

**Primary Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Managed PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities
- Built-in authentication and row-level security
- Automatic API generation for rapid development
- Scales from MVP to enterprise without migration

**Vector Database**: Pinecone / Weaviate
- Semantic search across all historical reports and insights
- Pattern recognition and similarity matching
- Enables "find similar issues" and trend detection
- Critical for the learning aspect of the system

**File Storage**: Supabase Storage / AWS S3
- Original report files (PDF, Excel, CSV)
- Generated output reports
- Audit trail of all processed documents
- Cost-effective with lifecycle policies

### AI & Processing Layer

**Primary AI**: Claude 3 API (Anthropic)
- Superior reasoning capabilities for financial analysis
- Multi-pass processing for accuracy
- Context window suitable for large reports
- Consistent, explainable outputs

**Document Processing**: 
- PDF parsing: pdf-parse / pdfjs
- Excel processing: xlsx / exceljs
- CSV handling: papaparse
- OCR backup: Textract (for scanned documents)
### Workflow Automation

**Orchestration**: N8N
- Visual workflow builder for non-developers
- Extensive integration library
- Self-hosted option for data security
- Cost-effective compared to Zapier/Make
- Critical workflows:
  - Email monitoring and attachment extraction
  - Report processing pipeline
  - Result delivery automation
  - Scheduled recurring analyses

**Queue Management**: Bull/BullMQ with Redis
- Handles asynchronous processing
- Retry logic for failed operations
- Priority queuing for enterprise customers
- Prevents system overload

### Communication Layer

**Email Processing**:
- Inbound: SendGrid Inbound Parse / AWS SES
- Outbound: SendGrid / AWS SES
- Template engine: Handlebars/MJML for beautiful reports
- Tracking and analytics included

**Future Real-time Features**:
- WebSockets via Socket.io
- Live processing status updates
- Collaborative features for team reviews

## System Architecture Diagram

The system follows a clear flow from ingestion through processing to delivery:

```
[Email with Report] → [N8N Email Trigger] → [Queue System]
                                                    ↓
[Vector DB] ← [AI Processing Pipeline] ← [Document Parser]
     ↓                    ↓
[PostgreSQL] ← [Insight Storage] → [Report Generator]
                                           ↓
                              [Email Delivery System] → [User]
```
## Security & Compliance Architecture

Security is paramount when handling sensitive financial data. Our architecture implements defense in depth with multiple layers of protection.

### Data Security

**Encryption at Rest**: All data stored in databases and file storage is encrypted using AES-256 encryption. Supabase handles this automatically for database content, while S3/Storage buckets are configured with server-side encryption.

**Encryption in Transit**: All API communications use TLS 1.3. Internal service communication within VPCs uses encrypted channels. Email attachments are processed in memory and immediately encrypted when stored.

**Access Control**: Row-level security (RLS) in PostgreSQL ensures tenants can only access their own data. API keys are scoped to specific permissions. Service accounts follow the principle of least privilege.

### Compliance Considerations

**Data Residency**: Architecture supports regional deployment to meet data sovereignty requirements. Database replication can be configured for specific geographic regions.

**Audit Logging**: Every data access and modification is logged with timestamp, user ID, and action details. Logs are immutable and retained according to compliance requirements.

**GDPR/Privacy**: Built-in data export and deletion capabilities. Personal data is tagged and can be anonymized or removed on request. Processing agreements in place with all third-party services.

## Scalability Design

The architecture scales horizontally at every layer to handle growth from startup to enterprise.

### Processing Scalability

**Worker Scaling**: Queue workers can be scaled horizontally based on load. Auto-scaling rules trigger new instances during peak processing times.

**AI Rate Limiting**: Intelligent rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion while maximizing throughput. Priority queuing ensures critical reports are processed first.
