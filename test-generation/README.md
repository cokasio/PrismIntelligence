# 🚀 AI-Powered Testing Strategy for PrismIntelligence

## Quick Start (Windows)

1. **Run Setup Script**
   ```cmd
   cd C:\Dev\PrismIntelligence\test-generation
   setup-ai-testing.bat
   ```

2. **Set API Key**
   ```cmd
   set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key
   ```

3. **Generate Your First Test**
   ```cmd
   aider src\services\email.ts -m "Create unit tests for email service"
   ```

## 🎯 Recommended Testing Order

### Week 1: Core Services
```cmd
REM 1. Email Processing
aider src\services\email.ts -m "Create tests for SendGrid integration"

REM 2. File Processing
aider src\services\fileProcessor.ts -m "Create tests for PDF, Excel, CSV parsing"

REM 3. AI Analysis
aider src\services\claudeAnalyzer.ts -m "Create tests for 4-pass analysis"
```

### Week 2: Integration & API
```cmd
REM 4. API Endpoints
aider src\api\routes.ts -m "Create integration tests for all endpoints"

REM 5. Queue Processing
aider src\services\queue.ts -m "Create tests for Bull queue jobs"

REM 6. Database Operations
aider src\services\database.ts -m "Create tests with Supabase mocks"
```

### Week 3: End-to-End & Performance
```cmd
REM 7. Complete Flow
aider -m "Create e2e test: email arrival → processing → delivery"

REM 8. Performance Benchmarks
aider -m "Create performance tests for AI processing with various file sizes"
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Start Small, Iterate Fast
```cmd
REM Don't try to get 100% coverage immediately
REM Start with critical paths:
aider src\services\email.ts -m "Create basic happy path tests first"
```

### 2. Use Fixtures for Real Data
```cmd
REM Generate realistic test data
aider tests\fixtures -m "Create 10 sample property reports with various formats and edge cases"
```

### 3. Mock External Services
```cmd
REM Create mocks for all external APIs
aider -m "Create mock implementations for SendGrid, Anthropic API, and Supabase"
```

### 4. Test the Tricky Parts
```cmd
REM Focus on complex logic
aider src\services\multiAgentOrchestrator.ts -m "Create tests for agent selection logic and error handling"
```

## 🔍 Measuring Success

### Coverage Goals
- **Unit Tests**: 70% coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints
- **E2E Tests**: 3-5 critical user journeys

### Run Coverage Report
```cmd
npm test -- --coverage
start coverage\lcov-report\index.html
```

### Fix Coverage Gaps
```cmd
aider coverage\lcov.info -m "Add tests for uncovered lines"
```

## 🤖 AI Tool Comparison

| Tool | Best For | Example Command |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Aider** | Interactive test creation | `aider src\service.ts -m "Add edge case tests"` |
| **Claude Code** | Test strategy & architecture | `claude-code analyze --test-plan` |
| **Gemini CLI** | Quick fixtures & mocks | `gemini generate fixtures --type property-report` |

## 🚨 Common Testing Scenarios

### Multi-Tenant Testing
```cmd
aider src\api\routes.ts -m "Create tests for multi-tenant email routing with CloudMailin"
```

### Error Handling
```cmd
aider src\services\*.ts -m "Add error handling tests for network failures, invalid data, and API limits"
```

### Performance Testing
```cmd
aider -m "Create performance tests: 1-page, 10-page, 100-page reports with timing assertions"
```

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Today**: Run `setup-ai-testing.bat` and generate your first test
2. **This Week**: Achieve 50% test coverage on core services
3. **Next Week**: Add integration tests for complete workflows
4. **Month End**: 70% overall coverage with performance benchmarks

## 🎉 Remember

- AI-generated tests are a starting point - review and enhance them
- Focus on business-critical paths first
- Good tests document your system's behavior
- Tests give confidence to ship faster
