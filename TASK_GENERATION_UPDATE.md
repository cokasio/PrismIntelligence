- âœ… Added task logging for visibility

### 2. Task Structure
Each task now includes:
- **title**: Clear, actionable task name
- **description**: Step-by-step instructions
- **priority**: 1-5 scale (1=urgent)
- **assignedRole**: CFO, PropertyManager, Maintenance, Accounting, or Leasing
- **dueDate**: Smart date based on urgency

### 3. Smart Assignment Rules

- **Leasing**: Vacancy filling, lease renewals, tenant screening

### 4. Due Date Logic
- Urgent issues (safety, overdue payments): 1-3 days

- Strategic initiatives: 1 month

### 5. Updated Attachment Loop
- âœ… Added task display in processing logs
- âœ… Shows total potential value from all tasks
- âœ… Mock insights now include example tasks

## Testing:

1. **With Real Claude API**: Drop a file in `incoming/` folder
2. **Without API**: The mock insights will still generate example tasks
